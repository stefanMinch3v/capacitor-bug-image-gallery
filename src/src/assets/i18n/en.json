  "In order to calculate a vehicle's cost from address A to address B automatically...": "To automatically determine the cost of a journey from address A to address B, we rely on a concept known as fuel efficiency. Fuel efficiency measures the number of kilometers/miles a vehicle can travel on one liter of fuel (whether it's petrol, diesel, electric, etc.). For instance, if your vehicle can cover 12.5 kilometers/miles with just one liter of fuel (calculated as 100 divided by 8), this means you have a fuel efficiency of 12.5 km/mi per liter. Sometimes, this value may not be available in our data integration, or you have the option to manually input it if needed.",
